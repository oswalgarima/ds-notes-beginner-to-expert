## 🧠 Problem: What Are We Trying to Do?

We are given a bag of numbers like this:
```
[2, 7, 11, 15]
```

We’re also given a number — let’s call it the “target.” Example:
```
target = 9
```

We need to find **two numbers** in the list that add up to the target.

In this case: `2 + 7 = 9`, so we return the **positions** of those numbers:  
✅ Output: `[0, 1]`

---

## 🪄 Goal:

Find **two different numbers** in the array that add up to the target and return their **indices**.

---

## 👶 Let’s Think Like a 5-Year-Old:

Let’s pretend you’re holding a number in your hand and looking for the “missing puzzle piece” to complete the target.

So for every number, you ask:
> “What number do I need to make the target?”

Then you check:
> “Have I already seen that number before?”

If yes — boom! You found your pair.

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step Example

**Input:**
```
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
```

- First number: `2` → we need `9 - 2 = 7`
- Second number: `7` → have we seen `7` before? YES!
✅ Output: `[0, 1]`

## 🧩 Clean Python Code (with logic explained)

```python
def twoSum(nums, target):
    seen = {}  # Dictionary to store number and its index

    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        diff = target - num  # What number do I need?

        if diff in seen:
            return [seen[diff], i]  # Found the pair!

        seen[num] = i  # Store the number with its index
```

---

## 🪄 Why This Works:

We remember the numbers we’ve seen using a dictionary.
Every time we see a new number, we ask:
> “Do I already have its perfect partner saved in my notebook?”

## 🔁 Summary Trick (One-Liner):

> Check if the matching number exists before saving the current one.

- **Problem:** Find two numbers in a list that add up to a target.
- **Real World Analogy:** Like finding a missing puzzle piece to reach the exact sum.
- **Key Idea:** Use a hash map to store what you’ve seen and look for complements.
- **Pattern:** Hash Map Lookup
- **Code Trick:** For each number, check if (target - number) is already in the dictionary.
