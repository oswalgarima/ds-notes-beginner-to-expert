Problem: What Are We Trying to Do?

Imagine you and your friends are all saying some words:
	•	One says “flower”
	•	Another says “flow”
	•	Another says “flight”

You want to know what part everyone started saying the same — the beginning part that all of them share.

That’s called a prefix — the beginning of the word.

So in [“flower”, “flow”, “flight”], they all start with “fl” → that’s the longest common prefix.

But in [“dog”, “racecar”, “car”] — none of them start the same, so the answer is ”” (empty string).

⸻

Goal:

Write a function that looks at a list of words and finds the longest matching starting part (prefix) for all the words.

⸻

Let’s Think Like a 5-Year-Old:

Real-life analogy:

Imagine all the words are lined up in a row. You start comparing the first letter of each word:
	•	Are they all the same? If yes → go to second letter.
	•	Are those all the same? Keep going.
	•	The moment one word doesn’t match → Stop! That’s the end of the common prefix.

⸻

Step-by-Step Example

Input:

["flower", "flow", "flight"]

Step 1: Start with the first word:

Let’s say we assume “flower” is our starting guess.

Step 2: Compare this guess with every other word:
	•	Compare “flower” with “flow”
	•	f == f → ✅
	•	l == l → ✅
	•	o == o → ✅
	•	w == w → ✅
	•	e ≠ end of “flow” → ❌ → So “flow” only matches up to “flow”
→ New prefix becomes “flow”
	•	Compare “flow” with “flight”
	•	f == f → ✅
	•	l == l → ✅
	•	o ≠ i → ❌ → So common part is “fl”

Final Answer = "fl"

⸻

Example with No Common Prefix

["dog", "racecar", "car"]

	•	Start with “dog”
	•	Compare with “racecar” → first letter doesn’t match (d ≠ r) → ❌
	•	So return ”” right away.

Clean Python Code (with logic explained)

def longestCommonPrefix(strs):
    if not strs:
        return ""

    prefix = strs[0]  # Start with the first word as our guess

    for word in strs[1:]:  # Check the rest of the words
        # Shrink the prefix until the word starts with it
        while not word.startswith(prefix):
            prefix = prefix[:-1]  # Cut the last letter
            if not prefix:
                return ""

    return prefix


⸻

Why This Works:

We keep shrinking the prefix until every word starts with it. The moment even one word breaks the match, we cut it shorter and try again.

⸻

Summary Trick (One-Liner):

Keep shrinking the guess until all the words agree on the beginning part.

Real World Analogy: All friends are whispering a secret — what was the part everyone said together at the beginning?
Key Idea: Start with the first word and keep cutting it down until all other words agree with it.
Pattern: Shrinking Prefix Matching
Code Trick: Use startswith() and shorten the prefix step-by-step.
