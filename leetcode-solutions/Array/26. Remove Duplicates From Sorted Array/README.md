## 🧠 Problem: What Are We Trying to Do?

We are given a list of numbers that is already sorted.  
Example:
```
[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]
```

Our job is to **remove the duplicates** from this list — but we can’t just delete things.  
We must **overwrite the array in-place**, keeping only the unique numbers at the beginning.

Then, we return **how many unique numbers** we found.

---

## 🪄 Goal:

- Keep each number **only once**
- Don’t create a new array — just change the input
- Return the count of unique numbers (let’s call it `k`)
- First `k` numbers in the array should be unique

---

## 👶 Let’s Think Like a 5-Year-Old:

Imagine you're organizing a row of stickers that someone gave you.

You want to keep **only the first copy** of each sticker and push the rest away.  
So you start lining up each unique one neatly.

Each time you find a **new sticker**, you say:
> “Oh! This one’s different — I’ll add it next to the last unique one.”

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step Example

**Input:**
```
[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]
```

- Start with the first number `0` — it's unique ✅
- Next is another `0` — same as before ❌ (skip it)
- Then `1` — new! ✅
- Another `1`, another `1` — same ❌
- Then `2` — new! ✅
- Then `3`, then `4` — each one is new! ✅✅

✅ Output: `5`  
Modified array becomes: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, _, _, _, _, _]`

## 🧩 Clean Python Code (with logic explained)

```python
def removeDuplicates(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0  # If the list is empty

    k = 1  # First number is always unique

    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[i] != nums[k - 1]:  # Check if new number is different
            nums[k] = nums[i]       # Place it in the next unique spot
            k += 1                  # Move pointer forward

    return k
```

---

## 🪄 Why This Works:

Because the list is **sorted**, duplicates are always next to each other.  
So we can go through once and compare with the last unique number we saved.

When we find something new, we copy it forward and move our “unique pointer.”

## 🔁 Summary Trick (One-Liner):

> Copy forward only the new number, and track the position for the next unique slot.

## 💬 Flashcard Style for LinkedIn

- **Problem:** Remove duplicates in-place from a sorted array.
- **Real World Analogy:** Like arranging a row of unique stickers and ignoring the extras.
- **Key Idea:** Use one pointer to check, and another to place new values.
- **Pattern:** Two-Pointer Traversal
- **Code Trick:** Compare with last unique value, then overwrite forward.
