# 🧩 Word Guessing Game in Python

A fun terminal-based game to guess a hidden word letter by letter. Designed using beginner Python logic and conditionals. Great for learning loops, strings, and lists.

---

## 🎯 Problem:

**Guess the word correctly before you run out of chances!**  
**Word Bank:** `['rizz', 'ohio', 'sigma', 'tiktok', 'skibdi']`  
**Total Attempts:** `6`  
**Victory:** If all letters are guessed in time  
**Failure:** If all attempts are used up

---

## 🔍 Python Code

```python
import random 
word_bank = ['rizz', 'ohio', 'sigma', 'tiktok', 'skibdi']

word = random.choice(word_bank)
word_guess = ['_'] * len(word)

attempt = 6

while attempt > 0:
    print('\nCurrent Word: ' + ' '.join(word_guess))

    guess = input('Guess a letter: ').lower()

    if guess in word:
        for i in range(len(word)):
            if word[i] == guess:
                word_guess[i] = guess
        print('Great guess!')
    else:
        attempt -= 1
        print('Wrong guess! Attempts left: ' + str(attempt))

    if '_' not in word_guess:
        print('\n🎉 Congratulations!! You guessed the word: ' + word)
        break

if attempt == 0 and '_' in word_guess:
    print('\n❌ You have run out of attempts! The word was: ' + word)
