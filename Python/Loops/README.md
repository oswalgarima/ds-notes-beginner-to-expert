1. 🔁 What Is a Loop?

👶 Simple Explanation:
A loop is like a robot that repeats a task again and again until you tell it to stop.

📖 Real-Life Example:
You are eating Lays chips one by one until the packet is empty — that’s a loop!

🧠 Memory Hook:
Loop = Repeat until done 🌀

⸻

2. 🔁 for Loop — The Counter-Based Loop

for i in range(5):
    print(i)

👶 “Hey robot, count from 0 to 4 and say the number!”

📖 Like stamping 5 papers one by one.

🧠 for i in range(n) = Do this n times!

⸻

3. 🔁 while Loop — The Condition-Based Loop

x = 1
while x <= 5:
    print(x)
    x += 1

👶 “Keep saying the number as long as it’s 5 or less!”

📖 Like brushing until the 2-minute timer goes off.

🧠 while = “Keep doing this while it’s true!”

⸻

4. 🛑 break — Emergency Stop!

for i in range(10):
    if i == 5:
        break
    print(i)

👶 “Stop counting when I say 5!”

📖 Like stopping your favorite show midway.

🧠 break = “Break the loop and run away!”

⸻

5. ⏭️ continue — Skip and Go On

for i in range(5):
    if i == 2:
        continue
    print(i)

👶 “Skip number 2 — don’t say it!”

📖 You give sweets to everyone, except your brother because he already got one.

🧠 continue = “Skip this round and move on!”

⸻

6. 🎯 else with Loops

for i in range(3):
    print(i)
else:
    print("Loop ended!")

👶 “Say ‘all done!’ after finishing the count.”

📖 You finish brushing → get a chocolate reward!

🧠 else = “Say something after loop finishes naturally.”
