🧠 Python If-Else Conditions — Beginner to Pro

🎥 YouTube Playlist: Python Programming for Beginners – If Else Conditions

🔑 What You Learned in These Videos:

1. 🧠 What is if in Python?

👶 Think of it like your brain asking:

“If something is true, should I act?”

📖 Example:

if age >= 18:
    print("You can vote")

🧠 Memory Trick: If = Check & Decide 🧠

⸻

2. 🔀 What is if-else?

Two-way choice:

If you’re hungry → eat
Else → sleep

if hungry:
    eat()
else:
    sleep()

🧠 Memory Trick: Either this OR that 🔁

⸻

3. 🔁 What is if-elif-else?

More than 2 choices? Use elif.

📖 Example:

if marks >= 90:
    print("A+")
elif marks >= 75:
    print("A")
else:
    print("B")

🧠 Memory Hook: Like a decision tree 🌳

⸻

4. 🧅 What is Nested if?

An if inside another if.

📖 Example:

if user == "admin":
    if password == "1234":
        print("Welcome Admin")

🧠 Think: Layers of decisions like peeling an onion.

⸻

5. 🆚 Comparison Operators

Operator	Meaning	Example
==	Equals	a == 5
!=	Not Equal	a != b
>	Greater Than	a > b
<	Less Than	a < b
>=	Greater or Equal	a >= b
<=	Less or Equal	a <= b

📖 Used in ALL if decisions — like math conditions.

⸻

6. 🔗 Logical Operators

Used to join multiple conditions:

Operator	Description	Example
and	Both must be True	age > 18 and citizen == T
or	At least one True	pass or luck
not	Opposite	not raining → means sunny

🧠 Trick: Like building filters in your head 🧠

⸻

7. ⛔ pass Statement

If you want to leave a block empty, use pass.

if condition:
    pass

📖 “Don’t do anything, just move on silently.” 🤫

⸻

8. 🎯 input() with if

You can take user input to control flow.

x = int(input("Enter number: "))
if x > 0:
    print("Positive")
