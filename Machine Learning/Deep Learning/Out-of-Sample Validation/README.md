📌 What You Will Learn Today
	•	What the data analysis pipeline is: a series of steps to take raw data and turn it into insights or decisions.
	•	Key stages in the pipeline, typically including:
	1.	Data Collection — gathering raw data from sources
	2.	Data Cleaning / Preprocessing — handling missing values, removing noise, formatting
	3.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) — looking at data with summary stats & visuals
	4.	Feature Engineering — selecting or creating variables that help models
	5.	Modeling / Analysis — applying algorithms or statistical tests
	6.	Communication / Deployment — sharing findings or building applications
	•	Why each stage matters: bad data = bad results; feature choice greatly influences model performance; findings are only useful if communicated clearly.

📌 Stage	👶 Simple Explanation	🧠 Memory Hook / Analogy
Data Collection	Gathering all your ingredients first	Like a shopping list — you need everything before cooking
Data Cleaning	Fixing mistakes, removing junk	Washing and slicing veggies before cooking
Exploratory Data Analysis	Looking around at data — understanding what’s inside	Tasting, smelling while cooking to see what’s needed
Feature Engineering	Choosing which parts of data are useful	Like picking spices that make the dish tasty
Modeling / Analysis	Running the “recipes” (algorithms) to see results	Cooking the dish using a chosen recipe
Communication / Deployment	Showing your dish to others or serving it	Plating and serving to guests

✅ Why It Matters
	•	Makes sure your insights / predictions are based on clean, relevant data.
	•	Helps avoid surprises: strange data can lead to wrong conclusions.
	•	Ensures your work is repeatable and understandable by others.
	•	Foundation for all machine learning work and helps in interviews / real‑world projects.
