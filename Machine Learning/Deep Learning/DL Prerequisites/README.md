## 📌 What You Will Learn Today

- The basic mathematics behind Deep Learning: linear algebra, calculus, probability, statistics.  
- Why understanding functions, derivatives, gradients, and matrices is important.  
- How Data and Computing resources (like GPUs) are needed to train Deep Learning models effectively.  
- Key skills needed before starting deep learning: programming (Python), understanding ML basics, working with data, using libraries like NumPy/Pandas.

## 💬 One‑Line Summary

> “To do Deep Learning well, you need strong math, clear code skills, and good data to drink from.”

## 🔁 Flash Revision Prompts

-1. What math topics are most used in deep learning?  
-2. Why are gradients/derivatives important?  
-3. How does probability help with model predictions?  
-4. Why do we need good hardware (GPUs) for deep learning?

---

## ✅ Why This Matters

- Deep learning builds on a lot of earlier knowledge; skipping prerequisites causes confusion later.  
- Many deep learning frameworks assume you know math basics; this helps you follow along.  
- With strong foundations, you’ll understand model behavior, tuning, and errors better.

## 🔎 Real‑World Example

Imagine you're teaching a robot to draw shapes:

1. First you teach your robot about lines, curves, angles → (linear algebra & calculus).  
2. You give many pictures so robot learns probability/statistics.  
3. You write code so robot can run instructions.  
4. The better hardware robot has, the faster it learns.
