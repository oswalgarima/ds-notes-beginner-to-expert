# 🧠 What Can a Single Neuron Compute?

---

## 📌 What You Will Learn Today

- A single neuron (in artificial neural networks) is like a simple decision maker: it takes inputs, multiplies them by “weights,” adds a “bias,” applies an activation function, and outputs a result.  
- The activation function determines whether the neuron “fires” or not (or how strongly it fires), giving non-linear behavior.  
- Single neurons alone are limited: they can compute only simple linear boundaries (e.g. “is input > threshold?”) unless combined into networks.  
- Example tasks possible with one neuron: AND, OR, simple classification that is linearly separable.

|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Neuron                 | Tiny decision unit: inputs + weights + bias + activation → output       | Like a small gate – opens only if enough input    |
| Weight                 | Importance of each input                                                  | Turning volume up/down for each sound            |
| Bias                   | Extra threshold that shifts where neuron fires                           | Like needing more coins before vending machine works |
| Activation Function    | The rule that decides strength of the response or yes/no                 | Like saying “yes softly” or “yes loudly” vs “no”  |
| Linear separability    | Only certain patterns a single neuron can tell apart                     | Can separate apples vs oranges if in simple line  |
| Limitations            | What one neuron *cannot* do (XOR, non-linear patterns)                   | Need many gates for complex logic                 |

## 🐍 & 💻 Example Code (Python & C‑Style Pseudocode)

### 🐍 Python Example

```python
def neuron(inputs, weights, bias):
    # Compute weighted sum
    total = sum(i * w for i, w in zip(inputs, weights)) + bias
    # Activation: simple step function
    return 1 if total > 0 else 0

# Example usage:
print(neuron([1, 0], [0.6, 0.4], -0.5))  # OR‑like behavior

```

💬 One‑Line Summary

“A single neuron takes multiple signals, evaluates with weights and bias, and fires only under certain conditions — but its decision power is limited to simple separations.”
